Spaghetti-monster - The wrath of globals-non-believers

A shoddy php site management toolkit by Ties Stuij

** Introduction

Spaghetti-monster started out as a forum but as the need grew it expanded into
code to manage a whole site, and so it does a bit of everything: It's got
support for a blog or individual blocks of text, all editable through a
web-browser with what my friends coin `edit-in-place', so it's also got login
and web-based admin functionality. It's got an rss spitter, an image resizer,
image-uploading, some ajax stuff in comments and some other places, multiple
language support through cookies and the command-line, a little last-posts
tracker, a dbase-backed tree-structured site navigator, captcha
protection... As a good programmer i'd really like to rewrite this stuff, since
it was the first project i did of this magnitude and it is quite dirty,
but it works quite ok on a number of websites, and i find it easy to modify if
the need arises, so it's hard to find the motivation; and i'm a bit attached
to this grumpy bear to tell the truth.

Well, i had great fun writing this bundle of php scripts, and by all means, try
to use them, but i didn't write them with a general end-user in mind, so be
ware. But then it's name instills more fright than is justified. On a base level
it's structured ok i guess; It's not really spaghetti-code, it's just a funny name;
or is it?...

I'm not planning to actually supporting this thing. It just feels like a
shame to lock up code on which i've worked for quite a bit without it ever
having tasted the fresh air of freedom. But if you do want to get it up and
running, the least i can do is give a few pointers on configuration:

- spaghetti-monster was written for php4. I didn't test on php5, but i wouldn't
see why it wouldn't run, but then there are always these little caveats...

- configure config.php in _lib/_base

- add the tables at the top of _lib/_classes/zenSession.php and
_lib/_classes/zenBlog.php and if you want to use it _lib/_classes/tree.php to
your dbase.

- change the yourname prefix in zenSession.php to your preferred prefix and edit
the PREFIX constant in _lib/_base/config.php accordingly. Also change the
SQLTABLE in config.php to reflect the table-name you substituted for the
table-name in zenBlog.php.

- there are initialInsert functions in zenSession.php and zenBlog.php use them
once in one of your pages in the root dir to populate them.

- configure the .htaccess file to point to the right directories

- make the _img/public directory world-writable

- the base site layout is to be found in _lib/_classes/skel.php, edit at your
preference/leasure

- css file to edit is to be found under _lib/_base/

- add pages at your leasure using the templates in the base directory. Don't
forget to update _lib/_classes/_skel.php to put your pages in the menu.

- make an editable static item by clicking 'add new text block in [your language]'
in your admin side-bar. Then populate the item, save it and click 'get textblocks'
in the admin app. You'll see a number next to your item. enter that item in your
showtext function in your preferred page (see _lib/_base/config.php and index.php
for an example). It's a bit of a hackerish solution but a clean way of implementing
this stuff would involve a lot more coding than my mere requirements would justify.

- the tree-navigator code in _lib/_classes/tree.php might or might not work
nowadays. I stopped using it.

Have fun!
